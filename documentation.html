The load json button calls my function to display the players names in the apropriate boxes, it is located below the board.
{
	it will display the players turn
	it will set up the board in action
	it will only allow for game play starting with the black piece.
}

All the pieces move and capture the way they should
I included the castle function.
I included a check function but the checkmate function is not setup.
there is a button if you believe you are in check mate. making it a self-declaired chackmate game. 
I included audio tags when the game begins, when a player is captured and when the game is reset
the players turn is displayed at the top of the board
A login to the game from the index page is optional but not required.  it can be accessed at the bottom of the chess instructions by clicking the play now button.
The game meets the other grading criteria.
game works best in firefox. and is functional in chrome, chrome doesn't include the board changing colors at begining.
