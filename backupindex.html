<p> <h3><li> <a href="https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTA2l4uJqkhEuGJBBHJ1iJgWsC7CLRvWGguNkdEu5FuMfSZiJQPhw"><b>  Rook</b></a></h3></p><p> The rook can only move in a straight line, horizontally or vertically. The rook may move as many squares as it desires,but it can not jump pieces.  If it collides with a piece from the opposite team, it will remove that piece from the board and take its place on that square. The rook is not allowed to collide with a piece of its own color  </p>
<p> <h3><li> <a href="https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSJtbM0eqsFrJqH0kQKqu0fbKUEMPXptD40QXPR9ikeHLR2KmfU"><b>  Knight</b></a></h3></p><p> The knight can move in an "L" shape.  It must move one of two ways:</p><p><ol><li> Option One: Vertical one square in any direction and horizontally Two squares either direction or <br><li>Option Two: Vertical two squares in any direction and horizontally One square either direction.</ol><p>The knight is the only player allowed to jump other players. If it collides with a piece from the opposite team, it will remove that piece from the board and take its place on that square. The knight is not allowed to collide with a piece of its own color </p> </p> 
<p> <h3> <li><a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSyGIougobiSj3LOJfO-2ZEIypXC13arTJJ9KN6W1PnxumPrVls"><b>  Bishop</b></a></h3></p><p>The bishop may move in a diagnol any direction, as many spaces as it would like. It may not jump pieces.  If it collides with a piece from the opposite team, it will remove that piece from the board and take its place on that square. The bishop is not allowed to collide with a piece of its own color  </p>
<p> <h3><li> <a href="https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS3I_lHpa4BxMBzYwgd84VnuuNGXbL6_5x3AemF68B2Z5PsFvO8Sw"><b>  Pawn</b></a></h3></p><p>The Pawn may only move verticaly accros the board. It may not move backwards.  On the pawns frist move it may move either one or two squares forward. All other times it may only move one square forward. A pawn is not allowed to collide with any other piece while it is moving forward in a vertical direction.  A pawn may take the piece of the other player on its turn only when the player of the opposite team has a peice diagnoly adjasent in a forward direction to the pawn. The pawn is to then occupie the position of the piece it removed.
<p> <h3> <li><a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT1afA6myhYUP7xPTa3OAnwZNSyoFx-zZJaAOioQwTGluX8PCMo"><b>  Queen</b></a></h3></p><p>The queen is the most specialized piece.  She may move vertical or horizontal as the rook does, or she may move in a diagnol as the bishop does. She may not do both in the same move.  She may not jump pieces.  If she collides with a piece from the opposite team, she will remove that piece from the board and take her place on that square. The Queen is not allowed to collide with a piece of its own color  </p>
<p> <h3> <li><a href="https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR-eQJEAVBaZnILM5lnuLQHumrfjNbE3ZSl9mW5mBANA_C7r-dJ"><b>  King</b></a></h3></p><p>The king is the only player that may not be captured. He is put in check or Check Mate.  The king may move one square in any direction. If it collides with a piece from the opposite team, it will remove that piece from the board and take its place on that square. The king is not allowed to collide with a piece of its own color  </p> 
<p> <li><h3>Check</h3></p><p>The king is put in check when he is in danger of being captured on the next move.  Once the king is in check, their next move must be to either move the king out of the way or move another piece to make it so the king is no longer in danger.</p>
<p> <li><h3>Check Mate</h3></p><p>The King is in check, he can not move and no one can save him.  The game has been won.</p>
